Grammar Checker
In this project, you’ll use what you know about 
iterating over arrays to gather information and improve the quality of a paragraph.

1.The 'story' variable holds the paragraph we’ll be editing. 
In order to edit the story, we turn it into an array. 
The .split() method separates the story string by the space character (' ') 
and stores each word as an element of the array.
To see the array we’ll be working with throughout the lesson, log storyWords to the console.
After you’ve viewed the storyWords array, comment out the console.log() statement before moving to the next task.
